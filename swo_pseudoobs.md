# Extracting  pseudo-SWOT observations  from eNATL60-no-tide in the EUROSEA target regions 

Aur√©lie Albert

In collaboration with M. Ballarota (CLS), the latest version of the SWOT Simulator (https://github.com/CNES/swot_simulator) was applied on eNATL60-BLB002 outputs (run without tides). 
Two different configurations of SWOT have been applied for the period of eNATL60 01/07/2009-30/06/2010 : the calval phase (fast-sampling) and the science phase (see Fig.1 and 2).
