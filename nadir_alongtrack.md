## Extracting alongtrack nadir SSH from eNATL60-no-tide in the EUROSEA target regions
Stephanie Leroux, UPDATED Feb 2022.

* _What?_ 
  - Along-track sampling of the model SSH (eNATL60-no-tide) in the MEDWEST subregion. 
  - The interpolation is made with the software gonzag (https://github.com/brodeau/gonzag) from Laurent Brodeau,  based on  the Akima interpolation method.
  - Each file is 6-month long:
  - In each file youâ€™ll find:
    - sla_unfiltered (the real obs value (SLA)
    - sossheig (Sea Surface Height interpolated at all alongtrack locations)
    - sossheig_np (Sea Surface Height at nearest model grid point )

* _Data:_
Sampling of the model SSH along the satellite tracks of :
  - JASON3
    - From 2020-07-01 to 2020-12-31.
    - From 2021-01-01 to 2021-06-30.
  - Altika, Cryosat-2 (c2n), H2B, Sentinel-3A, Sentinel-3B: TO COME SOON.
